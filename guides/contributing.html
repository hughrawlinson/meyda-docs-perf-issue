<p>We welcome any and all contributions to Meyda, including filing issues, feature requests, pull requests, feedback, and any other comments. Please familiarise yourself with our <a href="https://github.com/hughrawlinson/meyda/wiki/Contributor-Covenant">Contributor Covenant</a>. The core contributors are quite limited on time, so we’d really appreciate if you could stick to the following few rules:</p>

<h3 id="filing-issues">Filing issues</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Bug reports
    <ul>
      <li>Please include comprehensive instructions for us to reproduce the bug. If you can include the source, please do.</li>
      <li>If you have the time, please consider finding the problem within Meyda yourself, and if you’re feeling generous have a go at fixing it and submitting a pull request.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Feature requests
    <ul>
      <li>Keep in mind that the core contributors are not full time Meyda developers.</li>
      <li>If there’s a feature you really want that we don’t yet support, please consider implementing it yourself and submitting a pull request.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Pull Requests
    <ul>
      <li><em>THANK YOU!</em></li>
      <li>Please try and stick to a similar coding style to what currently exists. We intend to include a specified style in the future, but for now just try not to deviate too much.</li>
      <li>Always work on the ‘next version branch’, whose name is the version number of the next release.</li>
      <li>Please remember to update <code class="highlighter-rouge">meyda.min.js</code> using the build system.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Feedback can be sent to any of the core team via however you want. Our email addresses are available in the <a href="doc.gold.ac.uk/~mu202hr/publications/RawlinsonSegalFiala_WAC2015.pdf">Web Audio Conference Paper</a>, we’re all easily accessible on Twitter. If we have enough interest, we may establish a mailing list.</p>

<h3 id="build-the-project">Build the project</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Remember to do it.</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">npm run default</code></li>
  <li>This will run tests, so make sure they all pass and try and make sure any new code you’re submitting is covered properly.</li>
  <li>Pat yourself on the back for a job well done.</li>
</ol>

<p>As a quick aside, because of the workflow for updating code coverage building meyda will not automatically run code coverage. You can do this yourself by running <code class="highlighter-rouge">npm run coverage</code>, which will return a coverage report, but will not post the data to our monitoring service (this would require distributing the secret, which seems like a bad idea).</p>
